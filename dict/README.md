[`english.txt`](english.txt)
is [sourced](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dwyl/english-words/master/words_alpha.txt)
(gratefully) from
[`dwyl/english-words`](https://github.com/dwyl/english-words),
which places it unencumbered into the public domain.

[`english.dict`](english.dict) is a serialized prefix tree built from
[`english.txt`](english.txt). Running the application automatically uses this
file, generating it first if it is missing.
