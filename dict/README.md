Word list was post-processed to:

1. Remove proper nouns (really, anything with a majuscule character other than
  the lone word I)
1. Remove entries with non-alphanumeric characters
2. Remove entries without vowels (with the exception of CWM and CRWTH)

No attempt was made to remove other abbreviations, nor to preserve common
interjections (HMM, PFFT, â€¦).
